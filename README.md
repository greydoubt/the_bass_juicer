With The Bass Juicer, adjust the emphasis of low-end frequencies in your audio tracks with ease.

    After adding the plugin to a track in your DAW, click on the plugin to open its user interface.

    You should see three rotary sliders labeled "Low", "Mid", and "High" on the user interface.

    The "Low" slider adjusts the amount of gain applied to frequencies around 40Hz, the "Mid" slider adjusts the amount of gain applied to frequencies around 60Hz, and the "High" slider adjusts the amount of gain applied to frequencies around 80Hz.

    Move each slider to adjust the emphasis of loudness around the corresponding frequency.

    Each slider has a range of -24dB to +24dB, with a step size of 0.1dB. This means you can adjust the gain of each frequency band in precise increments.

    You can also automate the sliders in your DAW to create dynamic effects over time.

    Once you have adjusted the sliders to your liking, close the plugin window and continue working on your track.
